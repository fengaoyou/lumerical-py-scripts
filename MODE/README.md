## Mode Solution

Feel free to explore the following;

- [Waveguide Simulation](waveguide-straight)
  
  - Plots the Mode Profile of the waveguide
  
  - Calculates the effective index as a function of width.
  
- [vertical taper](vertical-taper)
	- Calculates the Effective Index as a function of the taper length.
