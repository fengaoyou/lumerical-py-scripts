## Mode Solution

Feel free to explore the following;

- [waveguide](waveguide)
  
  - Plots the mode profile of the waveguide.
  - Calculates the effective index as a function of width and height.
  - Calculates the effective index variation as a function of the width and height.

- [vertical-taper](vertical-taper)
  
  - Calculates the effective index as a function of the taper length.

- [directional-coupler](directional-coupler)
  
  - Plots the symmetric and antisymmetric mode profiles of the waveguide.
  - Calculates the L<sub>Ï€</sub> as a function of gap and distance.
