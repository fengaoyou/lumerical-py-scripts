## FDTD Simulations

Feel free to explore the following sub-directories;

- [Waveguide-Straight](waveguide-straight)
  
  - Plots the E-field profile of the propagated mode
  
  - Sweeps the waveguide width:
    
    - Calculate the transmission of the fundamental TE or TM mode.

- [Waveguide-Mode-Taper](waveguide-straight)
  
  - Plots the E-field profile of the propagated mode across the tapered waveguide section and calculates transmission.
  - Sweeps the taper-tip width:
    - Calcuates the transmission of the fundamental TE or TM mode.
  - Sweeps the taper length (Adiabaticity):
    - Calculates the transmission of the fundamentals TE, and TM modes and any higher order modes.
- [Waveguide-bend](waveguide-bend)
  - Calculates the transmission of the fundamental TE or TM mode as a function of the bending radius.
  - Plots the E-field profile propagated across the 90deg bending section.
